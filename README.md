# Week1Challenge
I viewed the source code. 
I noted that the code was not in the semantic HTML structure. I changed the elements to Header, Body, Section, Article, Footer, and Nav. 
I changed all of the current elements to semantic HTML tags. 
The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling. However, I was unable to split the main section in two. 
I added alt attributes to the images, and detailed the images. 
I can view the heading attributes
